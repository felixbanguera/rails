Ruby On Rails is the most popular library for building applications in Ruby.

In this oportuity I will be building a Graphql Rails server able to respond to single GraphQl like requests.

At this moment the requests available are:

  createLink
  createUser
  signinUser
  createVote
  deleteUser
  allLinks
  allUsers
  link
  
  BUt the request to be used by the IONIC client API found at this [repo](https://github.com/felixbanguera/ionic/tree/master/ionic2-graphql-apollo-client-master) are:
  
createUser
deleteUser
allUsers
